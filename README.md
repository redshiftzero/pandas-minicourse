Notebooks for my mini course on data analysis with pandas 🐼

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the Python requirements (the best practice is to do this in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```
